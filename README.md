# Leaf-Disease-Classification
Deep Learning(CNN on Image Dataset)

Description about Model is given in the file(Model_Description) in repository.

Aim:
It was an very interesting project that could help in the agricultural department everywhere. As the farmers from everywhere around world are moving on to modern day methods
and techniques and with increase in population it's important to obtain maximum production rate of crops and hence our project helps in that department to classify disease in 
tomato plants and provide best cure/pesticide at early stages of infection.
The project can be further focussed on training different diseases in different crops and providing them with effective solutions.

This Project was done for the research purpose.
The Orignal Research Paper(file in repository) and Dataset was obtained from the brazilian community website named "Digipathos"
